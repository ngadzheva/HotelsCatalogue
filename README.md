# HotelsCatalogue
<p> The purpose of this project is to create a catalogue of hotels in Bulgaria by region, based on XML documents with text and graphic content, describing the possible features of each hotel in the country. The catalogue presents graphical content through XML objects. Links in the catalogue - e.g. between regions and hotels, between chains of hotels and hotels in the chain, etc. - to be described by ID / IDREF attributes. Compile the description of 7-8 hotels and validate them with a properly designed DTD document. The created XML content is presented in PDF documents through generation via XSLT.</p>
